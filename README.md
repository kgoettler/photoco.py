# photoco.py

A quick utility for syncing image files from a memory card, and organizing them on a local drive.

I take a lot of photos but don't sync them to my computer at regular intervals.
I wrote this utility to help me quickly sync photos from my memory cards to my
computer and enforce a simple date-based folder structure.
